# Data log

Every download is logged here: source, endpoint/URL, parameters, retrieval
date, row counts and file sizes. The data itself is gitignored; this file is
the only thing under `data/` that is committed. Anyone with the repo can
rebuild `data/` by running the ingest scripts in `src/ingest/`.

Folder convention:

| Folder | Content | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `raw/` | untouched downloads | never edit by hand; scripts only add files |
| `interim/` | cleaned / filtered tables | can always be regenerated from `raw/` |
| `processed/` | model-ready datasets | can always be regenerated from `interim/` |
