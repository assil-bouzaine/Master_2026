# Step 12: Phase 3, ontology and knowledge graph

## 12.1 Competency questions (draft, 2026-10-23)

### What was done
- Drafted 13 competency questions in `docs/competency_questions.md`. Each one has:
  - the parts of the project it feeds: graph, inputs, constraints, explanations,
    validation, framing
  - a priority (MUST / SHOULD / COULD)
  - an example answer computed from dataset v3
- Started from the 10 questions of the critical review (`docs/feedback.md` §7.1) and added
  three:
  - **CQ11**, same-unit neighbours at a similar depth: the one positive signal of the
    knowledge-graph pre-check.
  - **CQ12**, annual abstraction by unit and use: the Pliocene framing.
  - **CQ13**, stacked and nested wells: the anchors for RQ3 and the evidence against a
    head-ordering rule.

### Why
A competency question is a question the ontology must be able to answer. The list is the
ontology's specification and, later, its test suite:
- A class or relation enters the ontology only if a question needs it.
- Each question becomes a SPARQL query in `tests/`, whose answer is compared with one computed
  separately from the parquet tables.

This keeps Phase 3 inside its time-box and gives Gate 3 an objective "done".

### What the example answers already tell us
- **CQ2 is the bottleneck.** Only 240 of the 2,137 groundwater abstraction points carry a
  BSS code; around W1, 4 of 148. Linking pumps to aquifer units needs its own data step
  (rules plus a confidence level).
- **Around Millas (W2), 110 Mm³ of drinking water** was pumped within 5 km over 2012–2023,
  against 17 Mm³ of irrigation. Whether it came from the Têt alluvium or from the Pliocene
  below matters for both layers.
- **Depth matters inside the Pliocene.** W1's three same-unit neighbours, 2.8 km away
  (DEM'TER 1–3), are screened at 15, 60 and 111 m; only one is at a depth similar to W1's
  97 m.
- **Two questions lack data:** canal command areas (CQ6) and restriction zones (CQ9). They are
  COULD.

### What to consider
- **Review the list** (add, drop, priorities). Open points:
  - the distance within which a pump can affect a well
  - what counts as a "similar depth"
  - a citable source for the irrigation demand of each crop group
  - a minimum contact area for `overlies` edges
- **Next:** step 2, reuse (find each term in the standard vocabularies, or define it in
  `lulcw:`); then the CQ2 data step.

    are written as SPARQL.
